GUI Calculator Version 1.0 (28/05/2018)

A GUI calculator, built with Java/JavaFX, that aims to follow the correct order of operations and mimic the functionality of the basic calculator included with iOS.

-------------------
TO DO LIST
-------------------

- Should also allow for multiple funcationality of the AC button (i.e, changing to C during calculation)

- Need to write code so that if order of operations is changed, but then changed again before sum completed, the number changes with it.  For example,
  typing 7 * 2 + 6 +, if I then press multiply or divide, it should change to 6, and pressing plus or minus again should change it back to 20.

- Key listener

- Move CSS styling from fxml to CSS style sheet

- Change colour of buttons when pressed

- Positive/negative button doesn't currently work for 0
